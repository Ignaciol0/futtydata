What a weird carrear has Mauro Icardi had. From being one of the best players in Italy for several seasons to completing a 50 million move to 
PSG and being a flop. To now being by far the best player in Turkey's first division.

Mauro Icardi is a 30 year-old palyer that plays as a striker on loan at Galatasaray and is property of PSG. He used to be on of serie A most deadly
atackers at Inter. He plays as a typical number nine but has lots of movility since he lacks the fisicality to be a big presence thats why he paired so
well with Lukaku in the 2019 and 2020 seasons.

Now in Galatasaray he has scored 15 goals and provided 7 assists in only 17 starts managing to get the player of the match in 7 matches.
Could he regain his form and be usefull in the new PSG.
