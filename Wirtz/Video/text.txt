Now there have been a couple more matches since the return of Florian Wirtz to Leverkusen. Leverkusen now are one of the most in form teams in germany
since the arrival of Xabi Alonso and are still contenders of the Europa League.

Florian Wirtz is a 20 year-old attacking midfielder that plays for Bayern Leverkusen. He is injury prompt and had a very bad injury at the start of the 
season but now he has been back for a couple of months and the team has notice it.

He has already managed 15 starts this season and in those apearances he had scored 4 goals provided 8 assits and created 10 big chances. He is very young
and if he were to leave Leverkusen it wouldn't be for a fee smaller than 100 million. Many clubs are interested but do you think he will get the move this season?
