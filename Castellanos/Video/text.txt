For you how didn't know who Valentin Castellanos is. Valentin Castellanos is an argenitnian footballer that played for New York City in the Mls producing some
very good seasons. This season he transfered to Girona in Spain and yesterday he had the best game in his carrear.

Real Madrid were the victim of this absolute masterclass of a performance. Real played a very bad game but Castellanos managed to score 4 goals with an Xg of 1.5 and these
were enough to make Girona win the game and reasure Barcelona of the title.

This season has been a not very good season for Valentin Castellanos that before this 4 goals he had 7 goals against the smallest clubs in Spain. He started slowly but now he is
gaining some very needed form. He most likely will stay at Girona and I think he is one to watch out next season.
