Yesterdays was the last chance that Arsenal had to hold on to the Premier League title now they have to rely on Manchester City losing some games so 
they can fight for the title. Its tough to see such a good Arsenal side lose to City in this manner but the performance of Haaland and De Bruyne is from 
another world.

De Bruyne Yesterday took the goalscoring role managing 2 goals and one assist. However he created lots of play with 2 big chances that were missed by Haaland.
He is having and amazing season so far and should be in the conversation of one of the best in the world.

Haaland had a strange game giving two assists to De Bruyne and finishing scoring a goal. He missed two big chances but managed to make so that 5 of his 6 shots
were on target.
