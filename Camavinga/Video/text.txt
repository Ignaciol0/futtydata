Camavinga was aready very highly rated due to his role in all the comebacks Real Madrd pulled last year but now he is consolidating as one of the
best in the world in a position that isn't natural for him. He has already played as a left back in a world cup final and other important matches.

If you don't know Camavinga is a very young 20 year-old french player that plays for Real Madrid. He came from the Ligue One team Rennes at the age of 18 and for a
small fee of 35 million. His value now its 60 million euros but in reality this could be a 100 million plus player if Madrid wanted to sell him.

This season he started in the same role of a rotational midfielder and starting not too many matches. However with Mendy's injury and his ability to play
out of position Camavinga managed to be Real Madrid's first choice left back.
