Piero Hincapie is a very good propect center back that is playing well for Leverkusen. He is one of the players that has benefited the most of the arribal of Xabi Alonso to
the german club.

Hincapie is a 21 year-old palyer from Leverkusen. He is 1.81 metter tall and is naturaly left footed. He plays as a center back but he has also been used as left back and 
left wing back. However in these two positions he has not done as well.

He is a very modern centerback helping a lot in play creation and also being a good defender he is very well suited to a three back formation. He is going to continue developing under
Xabi Alonso and if he continues like this he could be one very good centerback one day.
