Sauolo is having a very wierd season having some very good games against the top clubs in italy but also losing some very easy fixtures agaisnt the relegation teams. They are now in a worst for than normally
but still a solid mid table team in Italy and the one constant in this team is Domenico Berardi.

Berardi is an Italian 28 year-old player that has spent almost its entire carrear in Sasoulo being one of the leagues top players. He has been linked with Milan and Juve multiple times.
But has stayed in Sasoulo averaging more than 20 goals and assists in the last couple of seasons.

This season he hasn't played as much but is still having some very crutial performances like a hacktrick of assists and a goal against milan. He has become a club legend in 
Sasoulo and I personaly hope he sticks around for the rest of his carrear but would be a very good adition for a top Italian team.
