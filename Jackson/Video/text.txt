Nicolas Jackson is a player I know well since I have watched him for quite some time since he was in Mirandes and also at Villareal b and it was a player that had some good qualities
but for me wasn't going to make the cut. And boy I was in the wrong with him.

Nicolas Jackson is a senegalese player from Villareal. He plays as a stricker and is very agile while also being very tall. He played last season in the spanish third division. 

His starts for the first team started last year and he strugled to make some impact as a sub. But in the recent matches and with the new coach Nico has managed to score 6 goals and give 3 assists
in the last 5 matches managing an average rating of 8.3. He had a frustrated move to Buornemouth agreed and thanks to that he stayed and now could be worth much more than the 15 million he was going to
be let go for. I think that he should stay at Villareal and develop.
