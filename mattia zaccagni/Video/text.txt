Lazio are having a very great season being confortably in Champions League places and having been second for a good part of the season. A big deal of 
this success is the adition of Matia Zaccagni after last years good loan spell at Lazio.

Mattia Zaccagni is a 27 year-old forward that plays as a left winger. He is was normally regarded as a playmaker but this season he has broken his goal 
scorring tally and is becoming Lazio's most important attacker. He was bought for only 7 million and is now worth 23 million. The biggest con of this player is 
that he is injury prompt.

This season Zaccagni has surpased Milinkovic Savic as Lazio's most important player and despite Inmobile's quiet season Lazio are fighting for Champions League football.
Zaccagni has scored 10 goals and provided 6 assists and has apeared in the most important matches like against milan or juve.
