This season for Juventus was a wierd one since the were deducted points and then given back those points thus facing lots of uncertanty. But one of the good things
is that they gave lots of oportunities to the young players.

One of this young players is Gatti a 24 year-old center back that is settleling into the starting squad for Juve and being a tall is helping him to score some goals.
He has been good at the three back of Juventus.

This season he has only played 15 matches but those were enought to see the quality of the player doing exceptionaly well in the Europa League having two very good matches against
Sevilla and Sporting. This is a player that I am excited to see more in the future.
