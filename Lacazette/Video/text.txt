You know who is the top scorer in the Ligue one at the moment. It is not Messi, Mbappe or even Neymar, he doesn't even play for PSG it is Alexandre Lacazette.
He transfered for free this summer has he wasn't really wanted at Arsenal anymore.

Alexandre Lacazette is a 31 year-old player for french team Olympique Lyon. He still holds a 12.5 million valuation but due to his big wages he was left out at 
Arsenal. He joined Lyon in the summer and has recovered his form and is looking to have his best ever season in france. 

This season Lacazette has managed 25 goals and 3 assists in 32 matches. This is especially impresive due to Lyon not being one of the top teams in France. He is ahead Messi,
Mbappe and Neymar as Ligue's One highest top scorer.
