What a nice turn over has Trent's season had. He was mocked at the start of this season and the end of last season for being at a much worst
level defensively. But this season he has regained his level and shut the critics.

Trent Alexander-Arnold is an english 24-year-old right back that came from the Liverpool Academy and plays in a very creative role in Klop's system. He
is well known for his very good creative and distributive qualities but lacks a bit in the defensive areas.

This season from right back he has managed 8 assists being the sixth in the league in this regard and 24 big chances created being the third in this regard, with
this data he is beind De Bruyne and Bruno Fernandes the third best creative player in the league.
