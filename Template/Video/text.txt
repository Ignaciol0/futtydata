Rodrygo is having a very good season. He had a rough start even making it 18 matches without scoring a goal but now that Anceloti has been
playing him in his prefered position he has shown why did Real Madrid buy him.

If someone doesn't know Rodrygo Goes is a brazilian winger from Real Madrid only 22 years old but operating like one of Europes Best Wingers. 
Rodrygo has a problem at Real Madrid, his prefered position is the left wing but that one is ocupied by Vinicius and his other prefered position the 
second striker is not used at Real Madrid.

The positional dificulties have favored that Rodrygo doesn't play at its best. However Anceloti has realice about this and now the system allows Rodrygo to move in the 
middle and he even changes wings with Vinicius in some stages of a match to confuse the oposition.
