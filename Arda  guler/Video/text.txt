The new Turkish gem Arda Gular. He is one of those wonderkids that has been talked about for a long time since he made lots of people excited for his debut.
And last season that happend but its now that he is getting some more consistency and getting some starts for Fenerbache.

Arda Gular is a 18 year-old right winger that plays for the Turkish team Fenerbache. He made his debut last season and had a role of an impact sub as he did at the start of the
current season. Now he is getting some more consistency and he is delivering some pretty good performances.

He has some good performances but he hardly ever gets to play for a full match and that why even though he has scored only 8 goals or assists in 25 apperances, he only makes one goal or
assist every 87 minutes. He has made some impact in the Europa League having great performances in all the matches. He is wanted by many European Clubs like Barcelona, Atletico or Dortmund.
I think Dortmund or a medium size club would be the best for his development.
